        <h1>Hi, my name is Joe Binney.</h1>
        <p>I'm originally from the Atlanta suburbs, but I moved out to the west coast for college and now I live in Palo Alto. This year I turned 23.</p>
        <p>I started playing music when I was 7 and published my <a href="http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/235/23540.html">first piece of software</a> at 13. Music and software have been two of my biggest interests ever since.</p>
        <p>These days I'm finishing up my Masters in Computer Science at Stanford, specializing in Human-Computer Interaction. After that, I'll be working at Facebook as a software engineer.</p>
        <p>Check out my resume and network with me on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/jbinney">Linkedin</a>.</p>
